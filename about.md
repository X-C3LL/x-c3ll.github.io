# About this blog
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This blog is just my own notebook where I can publish some posts related to Infosec. Before creating this blog I usually wrote on [Tarlogic's blog](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/) and [BlackArrow's Blog](https://www.blackarrow.net/blackarrow-blog/), but I needed a corner where I could post articles with a "less corporative" style and this blog was born __:)__.

# About the author
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My name is Juan Manuel Fern√°ndez (a.k.a. [X-C3LL](https://twitter.com/TheXC3LL)) and I love to break & fix things. I started in the security world around the year 2006, when IRC & private forums were in its death throes. Between the years 2016 and 2020 I worked at Tarlogic's Red Team ([BlackArrow](https://www.blackarrow.net/red-team/)) as operator and manger roles, were we did tons of amazing things. After that I worked as Red Team Leader for Telefonica Tech. Since 2021 I'm part of the MDSec Red Team.

I am a proud member of [Ka0labs](https://blog.ka0labs.net/) and I usually play CTFs with the teams [Insanity](https://ctftime.org/team/812) & [ID-10-T](https://ctftime.org/team/50611). Also in recent years I have collected some [CVEs]({{ site.baseurl}}/cves.html)

Also I am the founder of [Adepts of 0xCC](https://adepts.of0x.cc/)

PS. As you could notice, my skills with CSS are close to NaN.
