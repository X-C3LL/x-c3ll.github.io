# About this blog

Originally this blog was just my own notebook where I could publish some posts related to Infosec. Right now is just my personal corner to talk about different topic that can or can not be related to InfoSec. Before creating this blog I usually wrote on [Tarlogic's blog](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/) and [BlackArrow's Blog](https://www.blackarrow.net/blackarrow-blog/), but I needed a corner where I could post articles with a "less corporative" style and this blog was born __:)__.

# About the author

My name is Juan Manuel Fern√°ndez (a.k.a. [X-C3LL](https://twitter.com/TheXC3LL)) and I love to break & fix things. I started in the security world around the year 2006, when IRC & private forums were in its death throes. Between the years 2016 and 2020 I worked at Tarlogic's Red Team ([BlackArrow](https://www.blackarrow.net/red-team/)) as operator and manger roles, were we did tons of amazing things. After that I worked as Red Team Leader for Telefonica Tech. Since 2021 I'm part of the [MDSec Red Team](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/).


I am a proud member of [Ka0labs](https://blog.ka0labs.net/) and I usually play CTFs with the teams [Insanity](https://ctftime.org/team/812) & [ID-10-T](https://ctftime.org/team/50611). Also in recent years I have collected some [CVEs]({{ site.baseurl}}/cves.html)

Also I am the founder of [Adepts of 0xCC](https://adepts.of0x.cc/)
